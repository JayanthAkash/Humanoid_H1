| Low                      | Causes slight reduction in performance but product remains functional | 5         | Low                    | Issue occurs in about 1 out of 400 designs          | 5        | Moderate             | Moderate likelihood of detection                        | 5        | 5      |
| Very Low                 | Causes minor issues, such as slight inefficiencies, without customer impact | 4         | Uncommon               | Issue occurs in about 1 out of 1,000 designs        | 4        | Moderately High      | Moderately high chance of detection                     | 4        | 4      |
