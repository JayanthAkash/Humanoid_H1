| 1 | SUP-CORE: Safety Supervisor MCU (S32K116) | Execute safety state machine & monitoring | MCU stuck / internal lock-up | Safety outputs frozen; e.g. Robot_Enable may stay high; STO may not be asserted on request → loss of safety function | 9 | EMI, clock instability, supply dips, internal HW fault | 4 | Use automotive-grade MCU; proper decoupling; robust clock and reset circuitry; separate noisy power domains where needed | Independent hardware watchdog and reset; external circuits pull safety outputs to safe state when MCU is not actively driving them | 5 | 180 | Requirement: Design safety outputs so that on reset/tri-state they go to safe level via external resistors; use an independent watchdog/reset configuration such that loss of MCU activity forces a reset and safe output state. | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |  |  |  | 0 |
| 2 | SUP-NVM: MCU non-volatile memory (code/data storage cells) | Retain configuration and control logic | Bit-cell corruption in non-volatile memory | MCU may execute unintended control sequences or use wrong internal parameters → safety behaviour may deviate from design | 10 | Radiation/ESD upset of memory cells, supply transients | 2 | Select MCU with ECC or parity on NVM; ensure clean power and proper decoupling; protect NVM supply and control pins | Hardware error flags from NVM (ECC/parity) if available; abnormal behaviour detected in lab validation | 7 | 140 | Requirement: Use NVM with hardware error protection where possible; enable any hardware error signalling pins; protect debug/programming pins physically (e.g. not exposed in production) to avoid unintended modification. | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |  |  |  | 0 |
| 3 | SUP-PWR-MON-24V-I: 24 V current shunt & ADC channel | Sense load current drawn from 24 V bus | Shunt resistor open (reads ~0 A) | Over-current or short-circuit conditions not detected; thermal or wiring faults on robot may go unnoticed | 7 | Solder crack, mechanical stress on shunt, over-temperature | 4 | Use Kelvin-connected, automotive shunt sized for worst-case current; robust footprint and mounting | Comparison of current reading vs other indicators during test (e.g. measured power vs ADC current) | 7 | 196 | Requirement: Include continuity check of shunt in production (measured drop at known current); document that persistent “zero-current” indication with known load must be treated as a service fault on the current-sense hardware. | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |  |  |  | 0 |
| 4 | SUP-PWR-MON-24V-PATH: 24 V current sense wiring + amplifier / filter | Provide accurate sense voltage to ADC | Sense path shorted or bypassed | Same as above: near-zero sensed current even during overload; supervisor is blind to over-current | 7 | Solder bridge, PCB contamination, misaligned components | 3 | Adequate clearances and solder mask between shunt pads and sense traces; use proven amplifier/filter parts | Production electrical test of voltage across shunt at a known load | 8 | 168 | Requirement: Add an electrical test step: drive a known load on 24 V and verify sense-chain output; if readings are inconsistent, board is rejected or reworked; document sense-path as safety-related hardware. | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |  |  |  | 0 |
| 5 | SUP-PWR-MON-24V-V: 24 V voltage divider & ADC channel | Monitor 24 V bus voltage | Divider resistor drift/open → wrong voltage reading | Supervisor may think voltage is OK when it is low/high; may not react correctly to battery fault or brown-out | 8 | Resistor ageing, wrong value, contamination, cracked solder | 3 | Use 1% automotive resistors; place away from high-contamination areas; follow derating and creepage rules | Voltage reading compared against external measurement during validation | 7 | 168 | Requirement: Provide access to 24 V measurement for calibration (testpoint); document tolerance limits; ensure mechanical design minimises stress on divider resistors (no large copper “anchors” nearby without relief). |  | TBD | TBD |  |  |  |  | 0 |

| 12 | SAF-ROBOT-ENABLE: Enable line Supervisor → H3 | Enable/disable robot motion | Enable line stuck high (short to supply, output driver fault) | H3 may remain enabled even when Supervisor intends to disable; safety then relies solely on STO and internal H3 functions | 9 | Short on PCB/harness, GPIO driver failure | 4 | External pull-down so default = DISABLE; physical separation from high-voltage or noisy nets | Enable line continuity tests; functional tests toggling enable and observing drive response | 7 | 252 | Requirement: Specify in interface that H3 shall not rely only on a single enable line; H3 shall require consistency with other signals (e.g. STO inactive, health OK); include periodic enable-line toggle tests in system validation. |  | TBD | TBD |  |  |  |  |  |
