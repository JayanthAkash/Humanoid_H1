TBD TBD 12 SAF-ROBOT-ENABLE: Enable line Supervisor \u2192 H3 Enable/disable robot motion Enable line stuck high (short to supply, output driver fault) H3 may remain enabled even when Supervisor intends to disable; safety then relies solely on STO and internal H3 functions 9 Short on PCB/harness, GPIO driver failure 4 External pull-down so default = DISABLE; physical separation from high-voltage or noisy nets Enable line continuity tests; functional tests toggling enable and observing drive response 7 252 Requirement: Specify in interface that H3 shall not rely only on a single enable line; H3 shall require consistency with other signals (e.g. STO inactive, health OK); include periodic enable-line toggle tests in system validation. TBD TBD 13 SAF-LIMP-HOME: Reduced-performance request Supervisor \u2192 H3 Request limp-home mode LIMP_HOME line open, shorted or not connected On degraded sensors/conditions, robot may either stop fully or remain in full-performance mode depending only on other mechanisms 8 Wiring fault, missing net connection, pin assignment error 4 Provide a dedicated line for limp-home separate from STO and Enable; use defined pull-up/down to known default state Continuity tests; functional tests where limp-home is commanded and H3 response observed 7 224 Requirement: Clearly define this signal in interface connector; document default level and behaviour; ensure harness and PCB pin-outs are verified; include at least one system test that exercises limp-home signal behaviour.

TBD TBD 18 H2-FAULT-HEALTH: H2 sensor fault / health signal H2 \u2192 Supervisor Indicate H2 internal faults Health/fault line open or stuck at single level Supervisor unaware of degraded perception or falsely sees permanent fault; decisions using this line become unreliable 8 Connector/contact failure, broken trace, short to rail 4 Bias network (pull-up/down) to make open-circuit detectable; robust connector and strain relief Continuity testing and simple functional test where H2 toggles health line during integration 7 224 Requirement: Reserve at least one dedicated health/fault line for H2; require continuity check in harness production; ensure that H2 can toggle this line during integration test to prove connectivity. TBD TBD 19 USER-FAULT-ACK: Local fault-acknowledge button to Supervisor Allow operator to clear latched faults Button stuck closed or making continuous contact Faults may appear to be acknowledged repeatedly without deliberate operator action; system might re-enable when not intended 7 Mechanical wear, contamination, switch short to ground 3 Use quality switch; physical protection against contamination; suitable contact rating Switch contact resistance/level checked during manufacturing; visual inspection 6 126 Requirement: Design the circuit so stuck-closed condition is detectable (e.g. via pull-ups and level timing in test rigs); specify that boards showing stuck contacts in production tests must be rejected or reworked.

Covers component-level blocks (24 V power tree, USB-C, CSI, Ethernet/5G, Wi-Fi/NVMe, CAN, fan, supervisor MCU) and module-level behaviour (board bring-up, Jetson boot, peripherals, safety behaviour, stress tests). PCB exists but no production units yet. Start with pre-hardware checks (schematic review, ERC/DRC). Then run component-level tests on first prototypes without SOM, followed by module-level tests with SOM and connected peripherals. Use black-box functional tests from Jetson OS plus white-box tests via S32K116 firmware. Prioritise power &amp; safety, then high-speed I/O. Each test case has explicit pass/fail conditions (voltages within tolerance, no CRC errors, link stability, safe-state timing, etc.). Plan is considered \u201cpassed\u201d when all P1 tests pass and no open P1/P2 defects remain. Lab bench with 24 V PSU, electronic load, DMMs, oscilloscope, logic analyser, CAN analyser, ESD gun (if available), thermal probe, Jetson AGX Orin SOM + modules (Wi-Fi, NVMe, 5G), cameras, router/AP, 5G SIM, H2/H3/H4 (or simulators), engineering time from HW, FW, Test. Main risks: (1) power-tree or sequencing errors could damage SOM; (2) high-speed interfaces may fail SI constraints; (3) safety logic may be incomplete; (4) limited prototypes. Mitigation: staged bring-up (no SOM first), current limiting, careful monitoring, prioritised test list; safety functions tested with dummy loads first."},{"location":"9_2_Component_Test_Plan%28bySchematicBlock%29.html","title":"2.
